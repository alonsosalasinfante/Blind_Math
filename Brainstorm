User Interaction: Arrow keys will guide navigation through the mathematical equation/formula the user wants to comprehend.
	Up/Down arrows: Used to ascend/descend hierarchies of math terms.
	Left/Right arrows: Used to navigate through the various terms within the same hierarchy

Questions:
	Will my program be analyzing .tex files or pdf documents? 
	Should I build a web-based app? 

Design:
	a) Initial working prototype: be able to read:
		1) Addition
		2) Subtraction
		3) Multiplication
		4) Division
		6) Parenthesis
		7) English variables
	b) 2nd working prototype: be able to read:
		1) All of the above, in any LaTeX specific forms
		2) All possible variables (Hebrew/Greek letters)
		3) Trig/Calculus/etc. symbols
		4) Exponentials

Ideas: Term class: Each term will be categorized as:
	1) Term (e.g. 12ab, a, 53)
	2) Parenthetical (e.g. (1+2), (231/ab), etc.)
	3) Operation (e.g. cos(12a), sum(a+2), int(ab), +, -, /, \frac{}{}, etc.)

Each term object will have a: left/right, up, down (go inside term if possible)
